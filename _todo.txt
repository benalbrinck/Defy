Three phases:

Collect data
- Use sportsreference module
- Rip all conference teams/stats
- Rip all team stats
- Then you can have a list of each team, w/ their team + conference stats together
- Find schedules to create data
- Repeat for each year back x years

Train network
- Use tensorflow and do the thing...
- Offshore this part...

Use network
- Basically input the teams in a .txt file
- Then it simulates the tourney w/ the network



NEW

- Have we tried to make it output the scores instead?
    - If we do this, we really can't do AugmentGAN
- Also need to normalize data
    - Could just load in data then normalize the entire thing all at once
    - Also will help with scores instead
